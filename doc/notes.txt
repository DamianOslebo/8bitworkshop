- vcs: INPTx needs to be added to control state
- sdcc: can't link asm files before c files (e.g. acheader.s must be last)
- what if >1 file with same name? (local/nonlocal/directory)
- what if .c and .s names collide?
- live coding URL
- resize memory browser when vertical div resize
- preroll the emulator so optimizer does its thing before loading rom
- wasm dynamic linking of emulators (https://github.com/WebAssembly/tool-conventions/blob/master/DynamicLinking.md)
- use alternate confirm/prompt dialogs
- https://github.com/jvilk/BrowserFS
- what if error in include file you can't edit b/c it never appears?
- markdown, verilog: can't share
- https://www.crowdsupply.com/tinyfpga/tinyfpga-bx
- HTTPS warning
- Safari: scope doesn't show while CRT in use
- recording video indicator
- stego shareable images (http://pico-8.wikia.com/wiki/P8PNGFileFormat)
- https://makecode.com/language?
- open ROM from URL?
- game starts even if switched away before first load
- vcs: break on # of lines changed (maybe using getRasterPosition?)
- profiler restarts when paused
- it's pretty easy to add a new file named like a library file (bcd.c)
- put globals into view/controller objects


WEB WORKER FORMAT

{code,platform,tool,dependencies}
{preload}

new:

{updates,buildsteps}
[{filepath,platform,tool}]

implicit rules
- push/shift build steps
- preprocessor, compile, assemble, link
- access to intermediate files

only build files that have changed

build options


BUILD PROJECT

local/foo.project/*.*
build all files in project
send update for dependencies at startup (single file version)
should be able to change file w/o reloading (Not platform tho)

pulldown selects file in project, or goes back to parent
gotta preserve editor windows for each one - window list
make source/disasm window visible when debugging
gutter info/errors in all files



UI REFACTOR

editor
debugger
disasm view
memory
profile
errors

separate into files

window methods:
- set
- mode
- get
- changes
- cursorActivity (inspect)
- gutters (setCompileOutput)
- current line / gutter marker (setCurrentLine / clearCurrentLine)
- source map
- global symbols
- pixel editor / find comment (openBitmapEditorAtCursor)
- update debug window (200 ms)
- inspect variable

file store mirrors that on worker

worker result:
{
	output:<rom>
	sources:{
		<path>:{lines, asmlines, listing}
	}
}

add file to errors

PIXEL EDITOR

everything is an editor
back/forward propogation
encoded <-> raw + spec + palette(s) <-> full tilemap <-> selected tile/sprite/metasprite
need references
panes: source code, metadata tree, graphics panes
decoded info:
- CHR tiles
- palettes
- maps/rooms
- metasprites
- metatiles
- sprite data (williams etc)
store in intermediate single file or embed in C/ASM?
we'd then have to generate C/ASM probably automatically
intermediate file could still be edited
switch between hex/graphic editor? (palettes should edit via hex)
final display types: number, color, sprite, etc
CHR editor has palette selector, obj selector
individual objects in single file or multiple files?
RLE compression

Types
- byte
- RGBA color
- structured object
  - metasprite
  - metatile
  - level actor
- bitmap
- array of stuff, array can have a shape (width,height) like numpy
Mappers can refer to multiple objs
Slice (window) of array for selections

AssetEditorView
- scan files for assets
- build hierarchical view of assets
- expand/collapse
- create editor upon expansion
- double-click to source file

Assets come from:
- chr files
- bitmap data in files
- structured data (palette, sprites, metasprites, levels, etc)
