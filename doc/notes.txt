WEB WORKER FORMAT

{code,platform,tool,dependencies}
{preload}

new:

{updates,buildsteps}
[{filepath,platform,tool}]

implicit rules
- push/shift build steps
- preprocessor, compile, assemble, link
- access to intermediate files

only build files that have changed

build options


BUILD PROJECT

local/foo.project/*.*
build all files in project
send update for dependencies at startup (single file version)
should be able to change file w/o reloading (Not platform tho)

pulldown selects file in project, or goes back to parent
gotta preserve editor windows for each one - window list
make source/disasm window visible when debugging
gutter info/errors in all files



UI REFACTOR

editor
debugger
disasm view
memory
profile
errors

separate into files

window methods:
- set
- mode
- get
- changes
- cursorActivity (inspect)
- gutters (setCompileOutput)
- current line / gutter marker (setCurrentLine / clearCurrentLine)
- source map
- global symbols
- pixel editor / find comment (openBitmapEditorAtCursor)
- update debug window (200 ms)
- inspect variable

file store mirrors that on worker

worker result:
{
	output:<rom>
	sources:{
		<path>:{lines, asmlines, listing}
	}
}

add file to errors
